### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ 
I'm Gianluigi, an applied mathematician with a strong interest in machine learning and computational linguistics. 
I recently joined the European Central Bank, where I conduct research on quantitative methods and natural language processing in the International Policy Analysis Division. 
Previously, I was a doctoral researcher at [Inria](https://inria.fr) and UniversitÃ© CÃ´te d'Azur, focusing on machine learning interpretability, under the supervision of [Damien Garreau](https://sites.google.com/view/damien-garreau/home) and [FrÃ©dÃ©ric Precioso](https://www.i3s.unice.fr/~precioso). 
I hold an MSc in Mathematical Engineering and a BSc in Applied Mathematics, both from [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/).
