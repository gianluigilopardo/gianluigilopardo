### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ 
I am Gianluigi, a **data scientist** working at the [European Central Bank](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/). 
I am currently researching **AI/ML methods for economic research** within the international policy analysis division of the ECB. 
Prior to this, I was a doctoral researcher at [Inria](https://inria.fr/) and [UniversitÃ© CÃ´te d'Azur](https://univ-cotedazur.fr/). 
My PhD thesis focused on the **foundations of machine learning interpretability**, under the supervision of [Damien Garreau](https://sites.google.com/view/damien-garreau/home) and [FrÃ©dÃ©ric Precioso](https://webusers.i3s.unice.fr/~precioso/). 
Previously, I earned an MSc in **mathematical engineering** and a BSc in **applied mathematics**, both from [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/).

Drop me a line if you're ever in Frankfurt, Rome, or [Brienza](https://www.basilicataturistica.it/territori/brienza)!
