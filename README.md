### Hi there! üëã
I am Gianluigi, a PhD student in Applied Mathematics at [Universit√© C√¥te d'Azur](https://univ-cotedazur.fr), where I am part of the [J. A. Dieudonn√© laboratory](https://math.unice.fr/) and [Maasai](https://team.inria.fr/maasai), an [Inria](https://inria.fr) team located in Sophia Antipolis.
I am currently working on th interpretability of machine learning models and algorithms, both by analyzing their theoretical foundations and by proposing new solutions, under the supervision of [Damien Garreau](https://sites.google.com/view/damien-garreau/home) and [Fr√©d√©ric Precioso](https://www.i3s.unice.fr/~precioso).
Previously, I took an MSc in Mathematical Engineering and a BSc in Applied Mathematics, both from [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/).
You can contact me by [e-mail](mailto:gianluigi.lopardo@inria.fr), on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gianluigilopardo/) or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gl_lopardo).
